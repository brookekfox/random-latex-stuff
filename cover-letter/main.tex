I am writing to express interest in the mathematics instructor position. I have two years' experience teaching mathematics in a college setting. I have taught precalculus, business math, and freshman-level general studies math. I also have experience supervising undergraduate TAs and tutors.

I am currently working in the tech industry as a web developer, and it is just not fulfilling. The math department is the only place I really feel at home; I love being around math everyday and sharing my love of math with the students. %It's so disappointing when people say that don't like math or they are not good at math; I hope to be able to change some minds about it.
I also have an interest in cooking; last year I completed a 20-week course at the New School of Cooking in Culver City.

If I can provide any additional information on my background, education,  or qualifications, please let me know. I can be reached any time via email or phone. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.\\
